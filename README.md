Cliff's BBQ Stand represents my pinnacle project for 2024 coded in Python.  
It is an ordering system for a small restaurant that includes the menu, 
order placement, payment, survey, subscriber signup, and admin functionality
that includes historical reporting.
All work is completely my own design and coding. Although 
as of (10/06/2024) I am still working on the front end web deployment,
the modules created so far are the culmination of several concepts I have 
learned since July 2023. After reading 2000+ pages of information, 
and adhering to a strategy of coding daily, I feel comfortable 
and confident enough to find solutions in Python or other languages.
