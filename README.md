Cliff's BBQ Stand represents my peak project for 2024 coded in Python.  
It is an ordering system for a small restaurant that includes the menu, 
ordering, payment, survey, and subscriber signup capability. All work is completely my own design and coding. Although 
as of (10/06/2024) I am still working on the front end web deployment,
the modules created so far are the culmination of everything I have 
learned since beginning to study Python in July 2023. After many online
tutorials and reading 2000+ pages of information, I feel comfortable 
and confident enough to tackle anything in Python or other languages.
